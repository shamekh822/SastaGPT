# SastaGPT  

## SastaGPT â€“ Transformer-Based Text Generation Model  

This project implements **SastaGPT**, a Transformer-based language model inspired by *Attention Is All You Need*. It is trained on a movie script dataset to auto-regressively generate creative text. The model provides hands-on experience in natural language processing (NLP), training Transformers, and fine-tuning on specialized datasets.  

## Features  

- **Transformer Implementation**: Built a Transformer model from scratch following the original paper.  
- **Language Modeling**: Trained the model on movie scripts for creative text generation.  
- **Fine-Tuning**: Adapted the Transformer to a specialized dataset for improved performance.  
- **Hands-on NLP Experience**: Explored attention mechanisms, tokenization, and training techniques.  

## Technologies Used  

- **PyTorch, Transformers**  
- **NumPy, Matplotlib**  
- **tqdm** (for progress bars)
